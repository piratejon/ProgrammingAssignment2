I did this for rprog-016 programming assignment 2. It includes some tests that exercise the behavior of the example vector mean caching function as a "warmup" for me and a test for the matrix inverse caching function that was assigned. The matrix inverse test operates on a pseudo-randomly generated 10x10 matrices with elements from rnorm(), which are assumed to be invertible but in rare cases could in fact be singular which will probably cause an error.
